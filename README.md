# Quadcopter-Project
It's my fifth Deep Learning project and the final project of the Deep Learning Nanodegree course from Udacity.

In this project I used an Actor/Critic Reinforcement Learning method and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) to make 
my agent able to learn how to hover in place to a Quadcopter.
